Steps:

Set up HTML page.  Keep it simple but crisp
Create components first
    - Timer to coumt down from 100 and display on page
    - Create array or object to hold the questions and the answers - dont worry about the questions yet. 
    - Create HTML page with 4 classes for the 4 choices of A-D (format using CSS).
    - Link the CSS file
    - Link the JS file 
    - Create the questions - but just start with an array of an array first - keep it simple so I can see the pieces,
    - Create a start quiz button that changes the CSS to display the question box. 

    Still to do:

    1. Tigten up all CSS
    2. Clear the check box after submission of answer
    3. Develop the actual questions
    4. Edit function Display Leader Board with conditional CSS
    5. Sort the leader board highest to lowest and add %
    6. Add something to time if person completes quiz before the time expires - to invoke "display: none" for the question and answer box. 
    7. Should i put all global variables in one place on the JS file? 
    8. Add ability to not enter initials "No thanks, but show me the leader board"
    9. format the leaderbaord table
